# PLC Optimization for Filling Systems with Siemens S7-1200 and OPC UA Integration
Enhanced efficiency in conveying and filling systems by optimizing Siemens S7-1200 PLC programming with TIA Portal, integrated with HMI for improved operational performance. Developed robust communication systems between a master PLC and slave devices, including RFID sensor integration, and established OPC UA communication between Siemens S7, Beckhoff, and B&R PLCs to support seamless interoperability across platforms."
